        <p>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a stylesheet language used to
          describe the presentation of a document written
          in a markup language like HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or XHTML). CSS describes how
          elements should be rendered on screen, on paper, in speech, or on other media. </p>

          elements should be rendered on screen, on paper, in speech, or on other media.</p>
        <h2>The Power of Separation</h2>
        <p>
          One of the fundamental principles of CSS is the separation of presentation from content. By keeping the
          styling rules in separate CSS files or within the &lt;style> tags, developers can maintain a cleaner and more
          organized codebase. This separation offers several advantages:</p>
        <p>
          Improved Maintainability: Changes to the website's design can be made by modifying the CSS files without
          altering the HTML structure. This simplifies updates and reduces the risk of introducing errors.
          Enhanced Accessibility: A well-structured HTML document, free from presentational clutter, is more accessible
          to assistive technologies like screen readers. CSS then enhances the visual presentation without compromising
          the underlying semantic structure.</p>
        <p>
          Greater Consistency: Applying a consistent stylesheet across multiple web pages ensures a unified look and
          feel throughout the website, enhancing the user experience and brand identity.
          Reduced File Size: External stylesheets can be cached by the browser, reducing the need to download the same
          styling information for every page, leading to faster loading times.</p>

        <h2>CSS Syntax: Selectors and Declarations</h2>
        <p>
          CSS rules are composed of two main parts: a selector and a declaration block.

          Selectors: Targeting HTML Elements

          Selectors are patterns used to select the HTML (or XML) elements you want to style. There are various types of
          selectors, allowing for precise targeting:</p>
        <p>
          Element Selectors: Target all elements of a specific type (e.g., p for all paragraph elements, h1 for all
          level-one headings).
          Class Selectors: Target elements with a specific class attribute (e.g., .button selects all elements with
          class="button").
          ID Selectors: Target a unique element with a specific id attribute (e.g., #main-navigation selects the element
          with id="main-navigation"). ID selectors have high specificity.</p>
        <p>
          Attribute Selectors: Target elements based on the presence or value of their attributes (e.g., [type="text"]
          selects all input elements with the type attribute set to "text").
          Pseudo-classes: Target elements based on their state or position in the document tree (e.g., :hover styles an
          element when the user hovers the mouse over it, :first-child selects the first child element).</p>
        <p>
          Pseudo-elements: Create virtual elements within the selected element to style specific parts (e.g., ::before
          inserts something before the content of an element, ::after inserts something after).
          Combinators: Define relationships between selectors
          elements that are descendants of elements, child selector ul > li selects all elements that are direct
          children.</p>

        <h2>Declaration Block: Defining Styles</h2>
        <p>
          The declaration block is enclosed in curly braces {} and contains one or more declarations, separated by
          semicolons. Each declaration consists of a property and a value, separated by a colon.</p>
        <p>
          The "Cascading" aspect of CSS refers to how styles are applied when multiple rules target the same element.
          The browser resolves conflicts based on several factors, including:

          Specificity: Some selectors are more specific than others. For example, an ID selector is more specific than a
          class selector, which is more specific than an element selector. More specific rules override less specific
          rules.</p>
        <p>
          Inheritance: Some CSS properties are inherited from parent elements to their children. For example, the color
          property is typically inherited.
          Source Order: If two rules have the same specificity, the rule that appears later in the CSS source will be
          applied.
          Importance: The !important declaration can override all other declarations, regardless of specificity or
          source order. However, its use is generally discouraged as it can make debugging more difficult.</p>

        <h2>Benefits of Using CSS</h2>
        <p>
          Adopting CSS for styling web pages offers numerous advantages:

          Improved User Experience: Well-designed and visually appealing websites can enhance user engagement and
          satisfaction.
          Faster Development: CSS facilitates rapid prototyping and design iterations.
          Cross-Browser Compatibility: While some browser inconsistencies may exist, CSS standards aim for consistent
          rendering across different browsers.
          Responsiveness: CSS enables the creation of responsive websites that adapt seamlessly to different screen
          sizes and devices through techniques like media queries.
          Accessibility: By separating presentation from content, CSS contributes to more accessible web pages.</p>
