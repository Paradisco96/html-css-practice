      <div class="article-first-letter">
        <p>HyperText Markup Language, or HTML, is the basic language used to
          create web pages. It's not really a
          programming
          language, but more of a way to structure the information on a website. Think of it like the skeleton of a web
          page;
          it tells the browser what everything is and how it's connected.</p>
        <p>
          HTML uses special words, called elements, to define different parts of a page. Most of these elements have a
          beginning and an end. For example, to make a heading, you'd use the heading element. The actual text of the
          heading
          goes in between. There are different levels of headings, from the most important to the least.</p>
        <p>
          Every HTML document has a specific structure. It starts with a declaration that tells the browser it's an HTML
          document. Then, everything else goes inside the main HTML element. Inside that, there are usually two main
          parts:
          the head and the body.</p>
        <h2>Web pages</h2>
        <p>
          The head section contains information about the web page that isn't usually shown directly on the page itself.
          This
          includes things like the title that appears in the browser tab, special instructions for the browser, and
          links to
          other files that control how the page looks or acts.</p>
        <p>
          The body section is where all the content that you actually see on the web page goes. This includes text,
          images,
          videos, and links to other pages. You can organize text into paragraphs, create lists with bullet points or
          numbers,
          and add horizontal lines to separate sections.</p>
        <p>
          Links are a fundamental part of the web, and HTML lets you create them so you can jump to other pages or
          different
          parts of the same page. You can also embed images and, with newer versions of HTML, even directly include
          audio and
          video without needing extra plugins.</p>
        <h2>Fundamental part of the web</h2>
        <p>
          To organize the content within the body, you can use container elements. These help group related things
          together so
          you can style them or manipulate them as a unit. There are also special elements that give more meaning to the
          structure of your page, like identifying the main article, side content, navigation menus, headers, and
          footers.
          This helps computers and people better understand the content.</p>
        <p>
          HTML also lets you create forms where users can type in information, select options, and submit data. These
          are
          essential for things like login pages, search bars, and contact forms.</p>
        <p>
          Over time, HTML has evolved. The latest version, HTML5, introduced many new features, making it easier to add
          multimedia, draw graphics, store information in the browser, and even access the user's location.</p>
        <p>
          In short, HTML provides the fundamental structure for all web content. It uses elements to define what
          everything is
          on a page, from headings and paragraphs to images and links. While other technologies handle the visual
          styling and
          interactive behavior, HTML lays the groundwork for everything you see and interact with online. </p>

        <h2>Special elements</h2>
